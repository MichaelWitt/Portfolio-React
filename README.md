My current and updated portfolio, in React.

## Michael Witt

Hello! My name is Michael. Welcome to my portfolio.

Full-stack web developer, digital communication specialist, and rapid prototyping professional!

I'm a UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp Student, NC State Public & Interpersonal Communication Graduate, and currently on the Rapid Cut Prototyping Sales Team. Highly skilled and well-read in many coding languages; I develop and program functional, beautiful, and intuitive websites and apps. I want to use my gifts and talents to code a better future, creating applications and software that enhances human well-being, increases and optimizes user efficiency, and develops the next hyperintelligent technology the world needs.

Thanks for stopping in! I look forward to working together to make the present and future a better place.
